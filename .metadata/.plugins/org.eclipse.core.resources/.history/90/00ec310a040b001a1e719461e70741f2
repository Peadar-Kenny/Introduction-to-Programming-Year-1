 readDoubleFromUser: prompts the user with a question and returns a double that was inputed by the user
 calculateMortgageRepayment: takes the principal and the duration of the mortgage (in years) and the APR of the mortgage returns monthly repayment.
 calculateMonthsToRepayMortgage: takes mortgage amount, annual mortgage repayment  and the apr and returns the amount of months it will take to repay the mortgage.
