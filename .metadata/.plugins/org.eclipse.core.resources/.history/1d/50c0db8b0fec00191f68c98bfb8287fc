/* SELF ASSESSMENT
   1. Did I use appropriate easy-to-understand, meaningful variables and CONSTANTS within the code? 
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: I didn't use any constants and I feel my vairiable names are easy to follow
   2. Did I format the variable and CONSTANT names appropriate (in lowerCamelCase and UPPERCASE)?
       Mark out of 5: 
       Comment: All variable names formatted properly
   3. Did I generate the computer's choice in each game correctly using a Random number generator?
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: The number was randomised each time
   4. Did I input the user's choice in each game correctly?
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: All user inputs were taken and used appropriately
   5. Did I correctly compare the choices and update the score appropriately?
       Mark out of 20: 20
       Comment: I have not run into an instance where the comparison was not completed correctly
   6. Did I inform the user of who won each game (and why) correctly?
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: The user is kept fully informed as to the results of each game
   7. Did I use an appropriate for loop to allow the player to play 5 games?  There should be only one loop.
       Mark out of 20: 20 
       Comment: I used a single for loop such that the user can select their own amount of games
   8. Did I output the final scores correctly after the 5 games were played. 
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: The final score is always output correctly at the end of a game
   9. How well did I complete this self-assessment?
       Mark out of 5: 5
       Comment: I feel that all my scores are fair for the work I have done
   Total Mark out of 100 (Add all the previous marks): 100
